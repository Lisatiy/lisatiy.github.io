趁着最近在返修论文，重新回顾了一遍[老顾](http://www.hungry-english.com/)讲的英文语法，感谢老顾推出的小白书，拯救了我的雅思考试，拯救了我的论文写作。

此篇博客将一直更新，方便自己查阅，也希望能够帮到他人。

### 定语用法

一般在名词前面，有时在名词的后面，为后置定语

* 介宾短语做后定

> in,at,on+名词/动名词 e.g. people in developed countries

### 状语用法

修饰谓语、定语和句子，位置非常灵活

* 放在动词后面

> 1. 表示速率的 adv. 如 **rapidly, quickly, fast, slowly** , e.g. The immigrant population has grown rapidly.
> 2. 修饰不及物动词放在后面. e.g. xx increased exponentially

* 不放在助动词前面

> sometimes 是 adv. e.g. xxx sometimes can xx

### 补语

补语补充说明前面的名词，或者形容词或者动词，是句子的必要成分，不可删除。

* 由句子结构决定

> Education has made students **knowledgeable**.

* 由固定搭配决定

> 1. 动词搭配 e.g. People **take** education **seriously**.
> 2. 名词搭配 e.g. People regard education as the **key** **to success**. 
> 3. 形容词搭配 e.g. People are **aware of environmental problems**.

### 非谓语动词

非谓语动词是补充当谓语的动词形式，包括 to do 和 doing

> The objective of pedestrainising streets is **reducing pollution**.
>
> One favourite pastime for university students is **taking pictures** in the countryside.

### 过去分词和现在分词

在句子里充当 **定语, 谓语的一部分, 状语**

* 分词充当谓语

  > 进行时态  
  > These students **are waiting** for final results.
  >
  > 完成时态  
  > I have written two books.
  >
  > 被动语态  
  > These materials **are given** by teachers.

* 分词充当定语

  * 前置定语

    > 名词和动词主动关系 -  现在分词 
    > We live in a changing world.
    >
    > 名词和动词被动关系 - 过去分词  
    > He is a changed man.

  * 后置定语

    > 主动关系-  现在分词  
    > I have two students **taking** the exam this week.
    >
    > 被动关系 - 过去分词  
    > Students **caught** changing cannot receive test results.  
    > 分词出现在名词(逻辑主语)的后面, **不及物动词的过去分词不能充当后置定语(因为充当定语的过去分词一定表示被动, 不及物动词没有被动)**

  * 分词充当状语

    * compared with 和 comparing with

      > 逻辑主语和动词主动关系 - 现在分词  
      > **comparing with** print books with E-books, **we** can find the E-books have attracted many young readers.
      >
      > 逻辑主语和动词被动关系 - 过去分词  
      > **Compared with** reading print book, **reading E-books** is convenient economical.

    * with + 名词 + 分词  描述主句的状态或条件

      > With the number o digital books **increasing** dramatically, many people are worried about the future of libraries.

### 单复数

* 可数名词单数不加冠词的特殊情况

> 1. 介词+名词单数 e.g. at school, by car
> 2. 所有格 e.g. students' choice

### 形式主语it、形式宾语it及逻辑主语

* 形式主语 It is + 形容词 + to do 不定式

> **It** is difficult to finish this assignment.
>
> 区分： sth important/esssential/beneficial to sth 中的to是介词  
> e.g. Young people should attend computer courses. This is important to **the improvement of digital skills**.

* 形式宾语 及物动词(consider, find, make) + it + 形容词 + to do 不定式

> I find it difficult to finish this assignment.

* 逻辑主语

  * 出现不定式结构(to do, in order to do)，注意逻辑主语的准确性。

    > In order to **attract visitors**, **policymakers** have decided to maintain historic buildings.  
    > Reading has enabled **people** to **increase knowledge** and **show creativity**.  
    > Modern farming techniques have made it possible for many **countries** to **deal with hunger**.

  * 分词充当状语，句子的主语是分词的逻辑主语。

    > **Compared with Japan**, the **US** had a higher crime rate.  
    > **Employees** are required to work overtime in many companies, **finishing everything** before going home.

  * 连词或介词 + doing

    > **When communicating** with others, **one** should show patience.  
    > **By setting** rules, **schools** can reduce behavioural problems.

### 状语从句

充当 **原因、目的、条件、让步、时间** 功能

* 状语从句不能独立存在

  > 从属连词:  
  > **because**, **although**, **while**, **so that**,in order that, in case, as long as 不能独立成句
  >
  > 并列连词:  
  > **but**, **and**, **so** 可以独立成句

* 连词(加句子)与介词(加名词)

  | 连词 | although, even, though, even if | since, because, as | as   | while, when, as |
  | ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---- | --------------- |
  | 介词 | in spite of, despite            | due to, because of | with | during, in      |
  |      |                                 |                    |      |                 |

  before, after, until 既是连词, 也是介词

  > Water is used so **fast** that it cannot be replenished quickly.
